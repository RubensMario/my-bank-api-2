# my-bank-api-2
A simple project of REST API with CRUD operations to manage bank transactions, using MongoDB-Atlas database.

This project is a study project developed during a bootcamp as a challenge. So it contains a lot of comments and some features that can be improved.


Dependencies: 
Express (to handle routes)
mongoose (to connect with MongoDB and data modelling)
dotenv (to define environment variables)

Future improvements: create handler module to middleware and error functions
